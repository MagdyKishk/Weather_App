I built this app ( website ) as a way to teach myself how to deal with fetching API and chaning Ui Acordingly  
You can Check the app on [Vercel]()

## About The Api
 The Api Used in this Project is [OpenWeatherApi]("https://openweathermap.org/")

I learned how to use Api(s) which will allow me to be more creative in the future  
I Also Learned how to deal with async Functions in JavaScript

## What Changes Would I Make If I Rebuilt It Again

I Would also make the image indecating the weather state change depnd on the weather
